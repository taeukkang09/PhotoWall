# PhotoWall

![Screen](/PhotoWallMain.png)

A photo repository search app made for the Shopify Fall 2021 Backend-Developer Intern Challenge. 
Use the search bar to search for your favourite images, and see them displayed in a grid. 


This project uses React.js and the Axios package to access the Unsplash API, where we can download images for free. 

## Get your own Access Key for Unsplash API

Before running, generate your own Unsplash API access key by visiting https://unsplash.com/developers, 
and add it to `src/App.js` on line 8. 

## Get Started

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine. 
2. Navigate to the project folder on your command line.
3. npm install
4. npm start
5. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Future Ideas

In the future with more time, I could implement user accounts in PhotoWall, where users can save the photos they like, and come back later to see them on a separate page, similar to Pinterest.
